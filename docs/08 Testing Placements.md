Our SDK has a test mode flag that if set, causes your placements to display our demo ads. This way you can easily test the production and the development version of your app separately. You can enable test mode for each ad by going in the Inspector tab and checking Test Mode.

We also provide some demo placements that can be used for testing. These placements have a 100% fill rate.

| Placement ID | Description |
|-------------------------|
| 5687 | 320x50 banner |
| 5692 | 320x480 interstitial |
