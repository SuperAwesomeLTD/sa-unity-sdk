To display a video ad you only have to set your app ID and then call the openVideoAd with your placement ID.

You can find your app and placement IDs on the [Dashboard](http://dashboard.superawesome.tv).

```
SuperAwesome.setAppId (__APP_ID__);
SuperAwesome.openVideoAd ("__PLACEMENT_ID__");
```

Do not forget to replace the `__YOUR_APP_ID__` and the `__YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID__` strings with your app ID and placement ID.
