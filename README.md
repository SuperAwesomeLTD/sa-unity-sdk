SuperAwesome Unity SDK
==========================

Version 2.0

For more information check out the [SuperAwesome Developer Portal](http://developers.superawesome.tv/docs/unitysdk).

## Notes
The click events are not triggered at all unless there is an EventSystem UI object. If this doesn't exist in the Hierarchy, add one from the GameObject > UI menu. Probably a good idea to have one added programatically if possible.
