Set deployment target in Unity to 6.0 (if it is lower)

pod init
Podfile
pod update

1. cocoapods settings needs to be propagated in the build target, but it doesn't since unity already set these values before.  Therefore you will have to manually add "$(inherited)" to all 3 build setting variables: OTHER_LDFLAGS, OTHER_CFLAGS, HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS
2. Unity did not set the build products path correctly, so you will need to correct it to look for where pods project will drop its libraries.  Set "per-configuration build products path" in build settings to this value: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)
